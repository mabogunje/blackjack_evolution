    BLACKJACK PLAYER EVOLUTION (BPE)
=========================================


The Matlab program (`BPE/BPE.m`) explores lightly the application of 
Evolutionary AI methods to improve a player's chances at winning a 
game of blackjack against a fixed dealer policy.

Initialization variables may be set at the beginning of the file to
experiment with different computation values, and at the end of the
file to control output.

By default it assumes random policies for both player and dealer,
computes based on it's default parameters, and outputs to the 
console as well as to a CSV file called `BPE_results.csv`

For more on what the program does, and how it works, see:
(1) Comments in `BPE.m`, (2) `docs/.*`, (3) `results/README`

Beyond these, no efforts have been made to further document
the experiment.
