===================================================================
    Included in this folder, are only two (2) sample results.
    One representative of the trivial case, where you aim to 
    beat a bad dealer. The other represantative of the complex
    case where you aim to beat a good dealer.
===================================================================

However you may create your own results easily, by modifying the
`EXPORT_FILE` variable in BPE.m and giving it your output a unique
filename.

NOTE THAT DEPENDING ON YOUR PARAMETERS, COMPUTATIONS MAY TAKE
EXPONENTIALLY LONGER TO FIND THE SOLUTION YOU DESIRE.

Do not be afraid to press `CTRL+C` and kill the program should
this occur. You can always try again with revised params and
see if you will be more successful.
